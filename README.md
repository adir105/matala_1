This is a short Document about shortest path problem.
in this project we will try to write a little piece of code to try and solved this issue the best we can.
we searched for a good enough open source that claim  to solve the problem.
after we found a code on http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/44sp/ , we downloaded it and tried to figure out what is the main idea behind it.
when we decided to trust the person who worth it and move on!
just one thing we did manage to do is test it out and see that it's working pretty good.

Shortest paths.An edge-weighted digraph is a digraph where we associate weights or costs with each edge.
A shortest path from vertex s to vertex t is a directed path from s to t with the property that no other such path has a lower weight.

#Properties
We summarize several important properties and assumptions.
*Paths are directed. A shortest path must respect the direction of its edges.
*Not all vertices need be reachable. If t is not reachable from s, there is no path at all, and therefore there is no shortest path from s to t.
*Negative weights introduce complications. For the moment, we assume that edge weights are positive (or zero).
*Shortest paths are not necessarily unique. There may be multiple paths of the lowest weight from one vertex to another; we are content to find any one of them.
